  - `payment-test-keys.html`
  - `payment-test.html`
  - `payment-diagnostic.html`
  - `payment-alternative.html`
  - `payment-old-backup.html`
  - `payment-new.html`
  - `clean-payment-test.html`
  - `deployment-test.html` and `.php`

### 3. `.gitignore` Updates
- âœ… Added exclusions for:
  - `test-pages/`
  - `*-test.html`
  - `*-test-*.html`
  - `*-backup.html`
  - `paypal-*.html`
  - `deployment-test.*`

### 4. Payment.html Enhancements
- âœ… Enhanced Stripe Elements initialization with:
  - Custom styling options
  - Locale auto-detection
  - Better error handling
  - Comprehensive comments for production integration
- âœ… Improved form submission handling
- âœ… Added detailed inline documentation
- âœ… Cleaned up title (removed PHP test marker)

### 5. Documentation
- âœ… Created `STRIPE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with:
  - Complete integration guide
  - Testing instructions
  - Troubleshooting section
  - File structure overview
  - Security notes
- âœ… Created `verify-stripe-implementation.sh` script
- âœ… Created this verification report

## Verification Results

```
âœ“ payment.html exists
âœ“ No PayPal references in payment.html (0 found)
âœ“ Stripe.js is loaded correctly
âœ“ card-element div exists

```

**Errors: 0**

## Files Status

### Production Files (Clean & Ready)
- âœ… `payment.html` - Main payment page
- âœ… `style.css` - All styling including Stripe elements
- âœ… `js/analytics.js` - Analytics tracking
- âœ… `stripe-webhook-simple.php` - Webhook handler
- âœ… `.gitignore` - Properly configured

### Not Used in payment.html (But kept for other pages)
- `js/payment-processor.js` - Used by shop.html (includes PayPal)
- `js/paypal-direct.js` - PayPal integration for shop

### Test/Development Files (Excluded from git)
- All moved to `test-pages/` or excluded via `.gitignore`

## What's Left to Do (Production Integration)

### Backend Integration Required
1. **Create Payment Intent endpoint**
   - Implement server-side endpoint to create Stripe Payment Intents
   - See `STRIPE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for example code

2. **Set up Stripe Webhooks**
   - Configure webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard
   - Use existing `stripe-webhook-simple.php`
   - Listen for: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

3. **Update Frontend**
   - Uncomment backend integration code in payment.html
   - Add success/failure page redirects
   - Implement proper error handling

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on HTTPS (live keys require HTTPS)
- [ ] Verify card element renders correctly
- [ ] Test form validation
- [ ] Test with Stripe test cards
- [ ] Verify webhook receives events
- [ ] Test success/failure flows
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness

- âœ… Order summary section
- âœ… Secure credit card payment form
- âœ… Card information input area (will show Stripe Elements when loaded over HTTPS)

2. Live Stripe keys will function properly
3. Card element will render input fields correctly
4. No additional changes needed to payment.html

### For Local Development
If testing locally over HTTP:
- Use test keys instead: `pk_test_...`
- Or use ngrok for HTTPS tunnel
- Live keys require HTTPS
